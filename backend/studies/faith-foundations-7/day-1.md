# Day 1: Faith Defined

## Study Focus
Understanding the biblical definition of faith

## Teaching Point
Faith is not wishful thinking, but confident assurance based on God's character and promises. It's the foundation of our relationship with God.

## Discussion Questions
1. How would you define faith in your own words?
2. What's the difference between faith and hope?
3. How does this definition challenge cultural views of faith?

## Reflection Question
What does it mean to you to have 'confidence in what you hope for' in your current circumstances?

## Application Points
- Identify one area where you need to trust God more
- Write down three of God's promises you can stand on
- Practice speaking with confidence about God's faithfulness

## Prayer Focus
Ask God to strengthen your faith and help you trust in His promises even when you can't see the outcome.
