# Week 1, Day 1: In the Beginning

## Opening Prayer
Heavenly Father, as we begin this journey together exploring Your design for marriage, open our hearts and minds to Your truth. Help us to see our marriage not just as a human institution, but as a sacred covenant that reflects Your own faithful love. May we approach this study with humility, ready to grow both individually and as a couple. Grant us wisdom to apply what we learn and the grace to love each other as You have loved us. In Jesus' name, Amen.

## Study Focus
Understanding God's intentional design for marriage as revealed in the creation account

## Teaching Point
Marriage wasn't an afterthought—it was God's intentional solution to the first 'not good' in creation. When God said 'It is not good for man to be alone,' He wasn't just addressing loneliness; He was revealing that human beings are designed for intimate partnership and mutual support. The Hebrew word 'ezer' (helper) is the same word used to describe God as our helper in times of need—it implies strength, support, and partnership, not subordination. This passage teaches us that marriage is fundamentally about two people becoming 'one flesh'—a unity that encompasses physical, emotional, and spiritual dimensions. Your marriage is meant to be a living picture of God's covenant love, showing the world what faithful, sacrificial love looks like in practice.

## Discussion Questions
1. When you think about the Hebrew word 'ezer' meaning strength and support, how does this reshape your understanding of partnership in marriage?
2. Genesis 2:18 is the first time God said something was 'not good.' What does this tell us about the importance of marriage in God's design?
3. How do you see your spouse as uniquely designed to complement your strengths and cover your weaknesses?
4. In what specific ways can your marriage serve as a 'living picture' of God's covenant love to your children, friends, and community?
5. What would it look like practically for you two to become more 'one flesh' in your decision-making, finances, and life goals?

## Reflection Question
Considering that your marriage is meant to reflect God's faithful love, what is one area where you feel called to grow in showing covenant love to your spouse, even when it's difficult?

## Application Points
- This week, spend 15 minutes sharing with each other specific ways you see God's design reflected in how He created your spouse
- Create a written 'marriage vision statement' together that describes how you want your marriage to reflect God's love
- Identify one area where you can work toward greater 'oneness' this month (could be finances, parenting, future goals, etc.)
- Pray together each day this week, asking God to help you see your marriage as a ministry to each other and to the world
- Plan one specific way you can serve as a 'strength and support' to your spouse in the coming week

## Prayer Focus
Father, thank You for the gift of marriage and for the specific ways You brought us together. Help us to see our relationship through Your eyes—as a sacred covenant designed to reflect Your love. Give us wisdom to honor the 'one flesh' unity You've created between us. Show us how to be true 'ezer' helpers to each other, offering strength and support in every season. May our marriage be a testimony of Your faithfulness to all who observe our life together. Amen.
